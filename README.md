# Sorting-Algorithms-in-Python

<br>

This is a project that tests 4 basic sorting algorithms in python on RANDOM arrays of sizes 10, 100, 1000, 10000

| Big-O     | Bubble Sort | Insertion Sort     | Quick Sort  | Merge Sort     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |  ---: |  ---: |
| Time Complexity     | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)   |    O(nlogn)   | O(nlogn)   |
| Space Complexity   | O(1)       | O(1)        |     O(logn)      | O(n)
| Stability   | Stable       | Stable         |     Non-stable     | Stable

It seems that Quick Sort is the supreme one in terms of speed
